🦕 1993: The Jurassic Spark
My journey began with Spielberg's Jurassic Park - the film that taught me technology could create impossible worlds. This blockbuster moment ignited a lifelong fascination with digital media and the communities that form around it.

⭐ 1995-1998: The Great Sci-Fi Wars
Witnessed and participated in the legendary Star Wars vs Star Trek forum battles. Later expanded into disaster movie obsessions (Deep Impact, Armageddon) - participating in those communities showed me how fans rally around shared catastrophic fantasies or shared universes. 

🎮 2001-2005: ROM Hacking Underground
Deep dive into the Pokemon ROM hacking scene - testing countless unofficial games, documenting community workflows, and I am now attempting to archive projects before Nintendo's inevitable takedowns. I am working on building a comprehensive databases of the ROMs if possible.

🐾 2003-2006: Virtual Economy Exploitation
Explored Neopets hacking and virtual economy manipulation. This led to broader web security research and understanding how online communities create and protect digital value systems.

🕳️ 2008-2012: Political Digital Anthropology
I partipated in the evolution of political discourse in online spaces during the Obama era. Studied how forums like debatepolitics and CityData transformed from neutral discussion spaces into polarized echo chambers. Also tried challengeing users beliefs in their predetermined viewpoints. Which led to various threats. 

🔥 About My Archive Philosophy 🔥

I'm a digital culture archivist disguised as a full-stack developer. I hope my GitHub will feature a living museum of internet history - from ROM hacking tools to political forum analysis scripts. Every repository will tell a story about how online communities form, evolve, and sometimes destroy themselves.

With several projects in progress I hope to curate a diverse library that spans decades of digital culture evolution. 

When I start a new project, I don't just search for existing implementations - I search for the stories behind the code, the communities that created it, and the cultural moments that made it necessary.

My Current Focus:
💡 Full-stack development with 6+ years building scalable applications

🏛️ Digital anthropology - studying how online communities evolve and radicalize

🎮 Game preservation - archiving ROM hacks and fan-made content

🔍 Forum archaeology - documenting the rise and fall of internet communities

🤖 AI integration with GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and open-source models for content analysis
