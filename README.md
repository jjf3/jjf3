👨‍💻 Software Engineer | Digital Culture Preservationist | Infrastructure Architect
Full-stack developer with 6+ years building scalable applications and 12+ years in Linux system engineering. Currently transitioning from infrastructure architecture to software development, bringing deep technical expertise and a unique perspective on digital community dynamics.
🚀 Core Technical Skills

Frontend: React, JavaScript/TypeScript, responsive web design, modern CSS frameworks
Backend: Node.js, Python, RESTful APIs, microservices architecture
Infrastructure: Linux system administration, Docker containerization, CI/CD pipelines
Databases: SQL optimization, data modeling, performance tuning
Cloud: Scalable system design, monitoring, automated deployment strategies
AI Integration: GPT-4, Claude API implementation, intelligent content analysis tools

🎯 Current Focus & Impact
Building applications that preserve and protect digital culture while solving real-world problems.

Digital Archive Platform: Developing scalable multimedia applications for content preservation with automated metadata extraction and community collaboration features
Open Source Contributions: Contributing to preservation tools and community-driven projects that bridge technical solutions with cultural impact
Security Research: Ethical security analysis focused on threat intelligence and community protection (responsible disclosure practices)

🏛️ Unique Value Proposition
I understand both the technical and human sides of digital communities. My background spans from ROM preservation and reverse engineering to enterprise Linux architecture, giving me insight into how communities form around technology and how to build platforms that truly serve their needs.

This perspective drives me to:
Design user experiences that reflect real community workflows
Build robust systems that can handle organic, unpredictable growth
Prioritize both technical excellence and cultural sensitivity
Create sustainable solutions for long-term digital preservation
