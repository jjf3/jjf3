🦕 1993: The Jurassic Spark
My journey began with Spielberg's Jurassic Park - the film that taught me technology could create impossible worlds. This blockbuster moment ignited a lifelong fascination with digital media and the communities that form around it.

⭐ 1995-1998: The Great Sci-Fi Wars
Witnessed and participated in the legendary Star Wars vs Star Trek forum battles. Later expanded into disaster movie obsessions (Deep Impact, Armageddon) - participating in those communities showed me how fans rally around shared catastrophic fantasies or shared universes. 

🎮 2001-2005: ROM Hacking Underground
Deep dive into the Pokemon ROM hacking scene - testing countless unofficial games, documenting community workflows, and I am now attempting to archive projects before Nintendo's inevitable takedowns. I am working on building a comprehensive databases of the ROMs if possible.

🐾 2003-2006: Virtual Economy Exploitation
Explored Neopets hacking and virtual economy manipulation. This led to broader web security research and understanding how online communities create and protect digital value systems.

Studied how forums like debatepolitics and CityData transformed from neutral discussion spaces into polarized echo chambers. Also tried challengeing users beliefs in their predetermined viewpoints. Which led to various threats.
